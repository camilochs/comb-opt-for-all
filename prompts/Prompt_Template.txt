You are an optimization algorithm expert. 

I need to improve this {{algorithm name}} implementation for the travelling salesman problem (TSP) by incorporating state-of-the-art techniques. Focus on:

1. Finding better quality solutions
2. Faster convergence time

Requirements:
- Keep the main function signature: {{the signature of an the main function}}
- Include detailed docstrings explaining:
  * What improvement is implemented
  * How it enhances performance
  * Which state-of-the-art technique it is based on
- All explanations must be within docstrings, no additional text
- Check that there are no errors in the code

IMPORTANT: 
- Return ONLY Python code
- Any explanation or discussion must be inside docstrings
- At the end, include a comment block listing unmodified functions from the original code

Current implementation:
