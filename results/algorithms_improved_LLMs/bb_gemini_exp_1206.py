# Function: 1-tree Lower Bound
def one_tree_lower_bound(distance_matrix, current_path, level, unvisited_cities):
    """
    Calculates the 1-tree lower bound for the current partial solution.  This is a *critical*
    improvement over simpler bounding methods.

    Improvement:
        - Introduces a more sophisticated lower-bounding technique using the 1-tree relaxation,
          replacing the simple average of minimum distances used previously.  This is the
          *core* of the performance enhancement.

    How it Enhances Performance:
        - The 1-tree bound is generally *much* tighter than simpler bounds, leading to
          *significantly* earlier pruning of unpromising branches in the search tree.  This is
          what makes the algorithm converge faster.

    State-of-the-art Technique:
        - Based on the Held-Karp 1-tree relaxation, a classic and very effective technique for
          tightening lower bounds in TSP. It leverages the fact that a minimum spanning tree
          (MST) on the unvisited nodes, *plus* the two smallest edges connecting the MST to
          the already visited part of the path, provides a strong lower bound.

    Args:
        distance_matrix (numpy.ndarray): The distance matrix of the TSP.
        current_path (list): The current partial path (list of city indices).
        level (int): Current level in the B&B tree (i.e., the number of cities visited so far).

    Represents a node in the Branch and Bound search tree.  This is essential for managing

    Improvement:
        - Encapsulates node-specific data, allowing for cleaner state management and,

    How it Enhances Performance:
        - Allows efficient tracking of nodes and their properties (bound, cost, path),
          which is essential for priority queue-based search.  This avoids redundant
          calculations and keeps the search organized.

    State-of-the-art Technique:

    Solves the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using an optimized Branch and Bound algorithm.

    Improvements:
        - Incorporates Held-Karp 1-tree relaxation for *much* tighter lower bounds.  This is the
          single biggest improvement.
        - Uses a priority queue (heapq) to implement *best-first search*.  This is critical
          for efficiency.
        - Employs a Node class for efficient node management.
        - Includes comprehensive error handling and edge case management.

    How it Enhances Performance:
        - **Tighter Bounds (Held-Karp):** The 1-tree relaxation provides dramatically tighter
          lower bounds than simpler methods, leading to earlier pruning of unpromising search
          branches. This drastically reduces the search space.
        - **Best-First Search (Priority Queue):** The priority queue ensures that nodes with
          the most promising lower bounds (i.e., those closest to a potential optimal solution)
          are explored first. This guides the search towards the optimal solution much more
          directly than depth-first or breadth-first search.
        - **Efficient Node Management (Node Class):** The Node class organizes all relevant
          information for each node, making the search process cleaner and more efficient.
