    Implementation of Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search algorithm for solving Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).

    Improvement: 
    *   We have modified the Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search algorithm to incorporate state-of-the-art techniques:
    *   **Guided Local Search (GLS)**: We now use a guided local search approach to escape local optima. This involves using a penalty function to discourage the algorithm from revisiting previously explored solutions.
    *   **Population-based Strategy**: The algorithm now utilizes a population-based strategy, maintaining a set of candidate solutions and iteratively improving them. This helps to increase the chances of finding higher-quality solutions.
    
    Enhancements: 
    *   The incorporation of guided local search enables the algorithm to more effectively explore the solution space, reducing the likelihood of converging to a local optimum.
    *   The population-based strategy allows for a more diverse set of candidate solutions, increasing the chances of finding a high-quality solution.
    
    State-of-the-art technique: 
    *   This implementation is based on the Guided Local Search (GLS) algorithm and the population-based strategy, both of which are widely recognized as effective techniques for solving TSP and other combinatorial optimization problems.
