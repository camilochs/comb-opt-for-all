    Improvement Implemented:
    - The "Don't Look Bits" heuristic is integrated into the 2-opt local search algorithm.
    
    How It Enhances Performance:
    - "Don't Look Bits" keeps track of cities that haven't resulted in improvements.
    - Cities that do not lead to improvements are temporarily marked.
    - This reduces unnecessary comparisons, leading to faster convergence times.

    - Based on the "Don't Look Bits" heuristic commonly used in state-of-the-art TSP solvers
      to accelerate local search algorithms like 2-opt.
