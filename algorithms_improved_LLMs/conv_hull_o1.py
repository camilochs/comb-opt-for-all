# New Function: Simulated Annealing for TSP
def simulated_annealing_tsp(distance_matrix, initial_route, initial_distance, max_iter=1000, initial_temp=1000, cooling_rate=0.995, verbose=True):
    """
    Implements a Simulated Annealing (SA) heuristic to improve the TSP solution.
    
    Improvement Implemented:
    - Integrates a Simulated Annealing procedure to escape local optima, allowing
      occasional acceptance of worse moves in order to explore a broader solution space.
      
    How It Enhances Performance:
    - By allowing uphill moves, SA prevents premature convergence to suboptimal solutions.
      The geometric cooling schedule reduces the temperature gradually, leading to faster 
      convergence as the search space is exploited more effectively in later iterations.
    
    Based on State-of-the-Art Technique:
    - Simulated Annealing is a widely recognized metaheuristic that has been successfully applied 
      to combinatorial optimization problems like TSP. The use of a dynamic cooling schedule 
      and probabilistic acceptance criteria is a state-of-the-art improvement over simple greedy methods.
    
    Parameters:
    - distance_matrix: A 2D numpy array containing distances between cities.
    - initial_route: List of city indices representing the initial tour (with the start city repeated at the end).
    - initial_distance: Total distance of the initial tour.
    - max_iter: Maximum number of iterations for the SA algorithm.
    - initial_temp: Starting temperature for the SA algorithm.
    - cooling_rate: Rate at which the temperature is decreased.
    - verbose: If True, prints progress information.
    
    Returns:
    - A tuple containing the improved route and its total distance.
    
    Note on Error Fix:
    - The selection of indices for the 2-opt move has been adjusted to avoid empty range errors.
      Specifically, the index 'i' is now chosen from 0 to len(new_route) - 3, ensuring that
      'j' (chosen from i+1 to len(new_route) - 2) always has a valid range.

# Function: Convex Hull Algorithm with Enhanced Local Search
def convex_hull_algorithm(coordinates, distance_matrix, time_limit=10, best_c=None,  local_search=True, verbose=True):
    """
    Constructs an initial TSP solution based on the Convex Hull heuristic and then refines it
    using state-of-the-art local search improvements.
    
    Improvements Implemented:
    - Incorporation of Simulated Annealing (SA) as an additional metaheuristic step prior to 
      the traditional 2-opt local search. SA helps in escaping local minima by accepting worse moves 
      with a controlled probability, enabling a broader exploration of the solution space.
    - The combined approach leads to improved solution quality (shorter tour distances) and faster 
      convergence by initially navigating the global landscape (via SA) and then fine-tuning with 2-opt.
    
    How It Enhances Performance:
    - The initial convex hull provides a good starting solution by capturing the outer structure.
      By applying SA, the algorithm avoids getting trapped in suboptimal configurations, and the 
      subsequent 2-opt search refines the solution efficiently. This hybrid approach leverages the 
      strengths of both global and local search techniques.
    
    Based on State-of-the-Art Technique:
    - The Simulated Annealing method, known for its effectiveness in combinatorial optimization, 
      is integrated as a state-of-the-art technique. Its probabilistic acceptance criteria and cooling 
      schedule allow for an effective balance between exploration and exploitation, leading to 
      better overall solutions.
    
    Parameters:
    - coordinates: A numpy array of shape (n, 2) representing the positions of n cities.
    - distance_matrix: A 2D numpy array containing distances between cities.
    - local_search: Boolean flag to enable or disable local search improvements.
    - verbose: If True, prints progress information during the search.
    
    Returns:
    - A tuple containing the final route (list of city indices) and its total distance.
